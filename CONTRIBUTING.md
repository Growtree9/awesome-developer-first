If you see something missing, please open a PR. I still do want to keep the quality of the list so not all PRs will be merged.

Terms of relevant products:
- Abundantly clear that is marketed for developers.
- "Headless", "API-First", "SaaS" are frequently used keywords.
- Usually this means that the front page has some code examples :)
- Products - tools/services that people pay for.

If you want to open a new category, please add some competitors so there won't be only one product.
